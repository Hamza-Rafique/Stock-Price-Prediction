# Stock Price Prediction

## Description
This project focuses on predicting future stock prices using historical data and advanced machine learning models. The goal is to analyze historical stock data and predict stock prices based on time series data, using techniques such as regression, decision trees, and deep learning (LSTM).

## Features
- Predict stock prices using different models
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Neural Networks
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Time series analysis for trend prediction

## Libraries and Tools
The project uses the following libraries:
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **numpy**: For numerical computations
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning models and preprocessing
- **keras**: For building and training deep learning models (LSTM)

## Skills Gained
- Time series analysis
- Regression techniques for stock prediction
- Deep learning models like LSTM for sequential data

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
